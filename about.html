                <p>Hiya! My name is Valerie (she/her they/them), but online I've gone by 
"Stankendesokies" (or just "Stan" / "Stank") for years. I actually came up with the name because of 
Pokémon Go! I was like 11 or 12 years old back when that game came out, and I had to think of a 
good username for the first time in my life. A couple minutes before I had to pick a name in that 
game my mom had mentioned that I had stinky socks (but in Dutch, because I'm Dutch.) And so I decided 
to name myself "stinky socks" (but in Dutch,) however, due to my horrific dyslexia I spelled it 
like "stankendesokies". And like, that was kinda funny, and it's an extremely unique name. So from 
that moment on I always called myself "Stankendesokies" in any game and social media.</p>
                <p>Anyway so, I'm an 18 year old trans woman living in the so called Netherlands.
And this is my personal website, where I will share my thoughts and feelings and whatever random 
bullshit comes to mind :3</p>
                <p>I'm an anarchist, and that'll definitely be noticable throughout this website. 
If you think that's annoying, or whatever. ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯ I don't really care?? It's <b>my</b> website 
I'll write whatever the fuck I want.</p>
