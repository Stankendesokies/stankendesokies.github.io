                    <p>So, my relation to gender is kinda silly and complex. Like, imo: gender is a bs 
garbage idea we (as in, humanity as a whole) made up, it's all in our heads and it means nothing. 
However, I can't avoid that other people <i>will</i> try and label me with a gender. And well, all I 
can say for sure is that I'm <b>NOT</b> a boy.</p>
                    <p>In case you didn't know: I'm AMAB (assigned male at birth.) But like, to me that 
genuinely is just some random unimportant autonomal state of my body? Like, idk, it's just so 
meaningless. So yeah, I've lied my absolute fucking ass off to the various "gender specialists" 
who I've had to confince that I'm "trans enough" to recieve estrogen. I've been painting the picture 
that I'm basically the most stereotypical trans woman to have ever excisted. Not because that's the 
truth, but because that's what <b>they</b> want to hear. And idk, maybe it's a bit of a silly 
sysytem when I feel like I have to lie to so called "specialists" in order to get the medicine 
I want/need?</p>
                    <p>Like, ok so actually, lemme explain the situation here in the so called 
Netherlands. So if you realize you're a trans person (be it a trans woman, trans man, nonbinary, 
agender, literally anything other than you AGAB (assigned gender at birth)) and you want to get 
HRT (hormone replacement therapy) you'll need to sign up to ✨the waitinglist✨. Which is a 
waitinglist of <b><u>3</u></b> to <b><u>4</u></b> years, to actually get through the waiting list 
there is the requirement that you've lived as your preferred gender for at least 1 year. But like, with 
the waitinglist being so long, that'll basically always be the case by the time they actually give 
any amount attention to you. And after all those years you can only start with "phase 1". Phase 1 is 
where you have many, extremely personal talks with a so called "gender specialist" for about a year, 
maybe 2. These talks aren't just about gender btw, they're also about your sexuality, your sex life, 
your mental state, your entire past, your goals for the future, and whatever else the "specialist" 
deems "necessary" to be discussed. Everyone I've ever talked to about this has said that these talks 
are waaayyyy too fucking personal, and embarrassing. And like, from personal experience: I fully agree 
with that. I'm sorry, but rather or not I'm into getting pegged does not actually matter for rather 
or not I should be allowed access to HRT???? But like the worst part is that if you don't confince 
those "specialists" that you are in fact "trans enough" they'll simply not give you the paper work 
needed to go to an endocrinologist. And guess what? Being autistic, having a "bad BMI" (fucking read 
<a href="../opinions/BMI_is_fucking_bs">this</a> page for more on fucking BMI), or being depressed 
are all "valid" reasons these "specialists" use to deny you your HRT.</p>
                    <p>So, after you get throught the 3 to 4 year waiting list, and the 1 to 2 years it 
takes to have all those extremely confronting talks with some random person who holds <b>all</b> of 
the power on your access to HRT, and whom you need to confince that you're "trans enough" to recieve 
said HRT. You now will be put on another ✨waitinglist✨. WOOOO we fucking love sitting around 
with gender dysphoria and shit, not being able to do anything. Also, by now you will be ✨gracefully✨ 
allowed to change your first name and sex marker in your ID / passport. Anyway, this ✨waitinglist✨ 
is for the endocrinology, which is the medical field that deals with hormones and shit. And it can take 
anywhere from a couple of months, to another goddamn year for you to get through it (that's dependent 
on what endocrinology clinic you've been assigned. The major hospitals have their own endocrinology 
sections, but there's also individual endocrinology clinics through out the country that you can be 
reffered to. And they all have different waiting times, but generally speaking: it takes TOO long!) 
But then finally, you can get your HRT. SIKE! You still need to have one more talk, this time with the 
endocrinologist, about the effects HRT will have on your body. At this point you'll already have had 
this exact same talk like 3 different times with 3 different people (who all have had the ability to 
decide that you shouldn't be allowed to get HRT.) But <i>then</i> you do finally get your hormones.</p>
                    <p>Unless you're not one of the "traditional transes", I mean, the system ofc still 
needs to be conservative in some bs way. We can't possibly just have the lives of trans people be 
easy in any way, shape, or form. So, if you're not the most obvious form of a trans man or trans 
woman, you're kinda just fucked? Like, you can still get your hormones and stuff, it's just gonna 
take 1 to 2 extra years or so to convince the "specialists" that you aren't "just going through a phase" 
or are incapable of making decisions for yourself because of your neurodiversity. And it's all just 
really fucking insulting to your autonomy as a human being, like, fuck that. Oh yeah! And not to 
mention that if you want an "X" in your ID / passport instead of an "F" or an "M" you'll literally 
have to sue the government to get your stupid ass fucking letter on your stupid ass papers, and it'll 
cost you between €1000 and €2000, and it'll take much longer than changing it to a "F" or "M" would 
take.<a href="#source1" class="footnote">1)</a></p>
                    <p>So yeah, when I got to talk to my "specialists" I lied my fucking ass off. Cuz 
like ofc I did? I just wanted E, and to change my name and sex marker. My gender is an unknowable, 
ununiform amalgamation of everything that isn't masculine. Like genuinely, the best definition I can 
give you of my gender is: "not a man" but like, I prefer to not have any definition at all for my 
gender. Anyway, I've got E patches now. But it took me like 3 years in total, and that's <b>fast</b> 
for Dutch standards!</p>
                    <p>You might've noticed that I've been putting quotes around the word "specialist" 
this whole time. That's cuz simply put: there is no "specialist" on your gender, except for you 
yourself. And it's increadibly insulting to require trans people to have to proof to some jackass that 
they are actually trans in order to get medicine. Like, give us some goddamn agency in our own goddamn 
lives? Unsurprisingly, lots of people are DIYing their HRT, cuz, duh? HRT is life saving medicine, 
being forced to live in a body that isn't right for you, and constantly being reminded of that by an 
extremely binary society is fucking depressing. And yes, that makes people want to kill themselves, 
ofc it does. Yet the """experts""" refuse to make HRT more accessible, because "what if we allow 
someone who'll have regreds in the future to perminantly alter their body?" Shut the fuck up man, we 
allow 18 year olds to get botox shot into their lips, and get a tattoo on their dick, all in the same 
day. Besides, the percentage of trans people who have regreds later in life, and want to detransistion 
is somewhere between 0.47% and 8%.<a href="#source2" class="footnote">2)</a> And the far majority of 
those people only detransitioned temporarily due to societal, financial, or family pressures. So our 
current system is: because a fraction of a percentage of trans people end up walking back on their 
decision in the future, <b>ALL</b> trans people should have to wait around half a fucking decade to 
get their HRT. HRT which would very quickly take away the majority of the reasons they might be feeling 
depressed, oh and if you're too depressed you won't get HRT, even if that's literally the biggest part 
of the fucking solution to your depression! All in the name of "preventing perminant mistakes from 
being made" because why? Cuz, we don't subject all young people to the same checks and balances. If 
you're just some random 18 year old bloke, who wants to get a tattoo of the random cringe band you 
just happen to be into right now, you can, without consulting <i>anyone</i>. But if you're trans and 
want to "perminantly alter your body", suddenly you have to share your entire sex life with some rando? 
<b>FUCK THAT!</b> This system is very obviously transphobic af.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gender is merely a social construct with only one goal: opressing a certain 
group of the population (be it women, trans people, or intersex people.) When a bunch of white men 
found out that sex isn't a static and easily defined concept, they just kinda made up gender in order 
to justify the orpession binary society had been living under for 
centuries.<a href="#source3" class="footnote">3)</a> And now that people have realized that gender too 
isn't a rigit binary, conservatives don't know what to do anymore and are just back to claiming that 
sex is rigit and binary again. It's stupid, pathetic, and just sad. Like, they really just <i>need</i> 
to opress other people so badly that they'll jump through any amount of logic hoops they'll need in 
order to do so. (Btw, that 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money" target="_blank">Jhon Money</a> guy, yeah, fuck him! 
7 July 2006 (the day he died) was a great day in human history :3)</p>
                    <p>So yeah, fuck gender, fuck transphobes, fuck everything.</p>
