## Hi, hello

Valerie (she/her they/them) here :3c

This repository is simply the place where I store all the code for my website: (website link)

So, I haven't touched HTML or JS in the past 4 years. Which means that I'm basically relearning both of those as I do this stuff.

I got my side nav bar to work and look decent enough, and I finally got OpenDyslexic to work on my website as well!!! Massive W :3

I love OpenDyslexic btw! My fav font of all time. In fact, I made that font my default font for Windows itself. So yeah fufufufu
