## Hi, hello

Valerie (she/her they/them) here :3c

This repository is simply the place where I store all the code for my website: (website link)

So, I haven't touched HTML or JS in the past 4 years. Which means that I'm basically relearning both of those as I do this stuff.

I'm doing quite good I'd say! The website now looks decent on phone as well as on pc, and I've added an about page :3

Soon I'll be able to actually start writig opinions and blogs and whatnot (y'know, the whole point of this website lol)

I added my first actual page!!!!
I'll probably end up adding more stuff to it in the future though, but yeah! I finally achieved what I had set out to achieve >:3c
