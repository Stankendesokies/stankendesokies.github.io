## Hi, hello

Valerie (she/her they/them) here :3c

This repository is simply the place where I store all the code for my website: (website link)

So, I haven't touched HTML or JS in the past 4 years. Which means that I'm basically relearning both of those as I do this stuff.

I'm doing quite good I'd say! The website now looks decent on phone as well as on pc, and I've added an about page :3

I have finished writing and recording my article on BMI, next I'll update the main page to actually like look nice and stuff. But that'll come later this week, or even later, idk.
