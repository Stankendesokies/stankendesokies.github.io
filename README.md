## Hi, hello

Valerie (she/her they/them) here :3c

This repository is simply the place where I store all the code for my website: (website link)

I'm currently learning how all this even works, so yeah, there ain't no website yet!
But I'm sure I'll get there like soon enough :shrug:

I actually already made my first big mistake. I made a repository on github pages called "stankendesokies" when it should've been "stankendesokies.github.io"
But I fixed it now! (Also it's 06:19AM, I just came back from my night shift. So I'll go eep pretty soon x3)
