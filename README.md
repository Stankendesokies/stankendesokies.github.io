## Hi, hello

Valerie (she/her they/them) here :3c

This repository is simply the place where I store all the code for my website: (website link)

So, I haven't touched HTML or JS in the past 4 years. Which means that I'm basically relearning both of those as I do this stuff.

I'm doing quite good I'd say! The website now looks decent on phone as well as on pc, and I've added an about page :3

Soon I'll be able to actually start writig opinions and blogs and whatnot (y'know, the whole point of this website lol)

Today I did a whole bunch of shit, I made the CSS code more clean (with multiple files and stuff), I tried real fucking hard to make a custom audio player, didn't work out in the end, and I tried making the audio player play at all on my phone, but meh, it just decided that it doesn't feel like it. So yeah, fuck it, I made it so the audio player doesn't display at all if ur on phone :shrug:
