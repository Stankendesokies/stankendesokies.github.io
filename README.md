## Hi, hello

Valerie (she/her they/them) here :3c

This repository is simply the place where I store all the code for my website: (website link)

So, I haven't touched HTML or JS in the past 4 years. Which means that I'm basically relearning both of those as I do this stuff.

I'm doing quite good I'd say! The website now looks decent on phone as well as on pc, and I've added an about page :3

I've added my own custom audio player in the most cursed way (useing <video>).
But it works, even on my iPhone!!
