                <p>So, my relation to gender is kinda silly and complex. Like, imo: gender is a bs 
garbage idea we (as in, humanity as a whole) made up, it's all in our heads and it means nothing. 
However, I can't avoid that other people <i>will</i> try and label me with a gender. And well, all I 
can say for sure is that I'm definitely <b>NOT</b> a boy.</p>
                <p>In case you didn't know: I'm AMAB (assigned male at birth.) But like, to me that 
genuinely is just some random unimportant autonomal state of my body? Like, idk, it's just so 
meaningless. So yeah, I've lied my absolute fucking ass off to the various "gender specialists" 
who I've had to confince that I'm "trans enough" to recieve estrogen. I've been painting the picture 
that I'm basically the most stereotypical trans woman to have ever excisted. Not because that's the 
truth, but because that's what <b>they</b> want to hear. And idk, maybe it's a bit of a silly 
sysytem when I feel like I have to lie to so called "specialists" in order to get some medicine 
I want/need?</p>
                <p>Like, ok so actually, lemme explain the situation here in the so called 
Netherlands. So if you realize you're a trans person (be it a trans woman, trans man, nonbinary, 
agender, literally anything other than you AGAB (assigned gender at birth)) and you want to get 
HRT (hormone replacement therapy) you'll need to sign up to ✨the waitinglist✨. Which is a 
waitinglist of <b><u>3</u></b> to <b><u>4</u></b> years, and after all those years you can only 
start with phase 1. Phase 1 is where you have many, extremely personal talks with a so called 
"gender specialist" for about a year, maybe 2. These talks aren't just about gender btw, they're 
also about your sexuality, your sex life, your mental state, your entire past, your goals for the 
future, and whatever else the "specialist" deems "necessary" to be discussed. Everyone I've ever 
talked with about this has said that these talks are waaayyyy too fucking personal, and embarrassing. 
And like, from personal experience: I fully agree with that. I'm sorry, but rather or not I'm into 
getting pegged does not actually matter for rather or not I should be allowed access to HRT???? But 
like the worst part is that if you don't confince those "specialists" that you're in fact "trans 
enough" they'll simply not give you the paper work needed to go to an endocrinologist. And guess what? 
Being autistic, having a "bad BMI" (fucking read <a href="opinions/BMI_is_fucking_bs">this</a> page for more 
no fucking BMI), or being depressed are all "valid" reasons these "specialists" use to deny you your 
HRT.</p>
                <p>So, after you get throught the 3 to 4 year waiting list, and the 1 to 2 year it 
takes to have all those extremely confronting talks with some random person who hold <b>all</b> of 
the power on your access to HRT, and whom you need to confince that you're "trans enough" to recieve 
said HRT. You now will be put on another ✨waitinglist✨. WOOOO we fucking love sitting around 
with gender dysphoria and shit not being able to do anything. Also, you will be ✨gracefully✨ 
allowed to change your name and sex marker in your ID / passport. Anyway, this ✨waitinglist✨ is 
for the endocrinology, which is the medical field that deals with hormones and shit. And it can take 
anywhere from a couple of months, to another goddamn year for you to get through it (that's dependent 
on what endocrinology clinic you've been assigned.) But then finally, you can get your HRT. SIKE! 
You still need to have one more talk, this time with the endocrinologist, about the effects HRT will 
have on your body. At this point you'll already have had this talk like 3 different times with 3 
different people (who all have had the ability to decide that you shouldn't be allowed to get HRT.) 
But <i>then</i> you do finally get your hormones.</p>
                <p>Unless you're not one of the "traditional transes", I mean, the system ofc still 
needs to be conservative in some bs way. We can't possibly just have the lives of trans people be 
easy in any way, shape, or form. So, if you're not the most obvious form of a trans man or trans 
woman, you're kinda just fucked? Like, you can still get your hormones and stuff, it's just gonna 
take an extra 2 years or so to convince the "specialists" that you aren't "just going through a phase" 
or are incapable of making decisions for yourself because of your neurodiversity. And it's all just 
really fucking insulting to your autonomy as a human being, like, fuck that. Oh yeah! And not to 
mention that if you want an "X" in your ID / passport instead of an "F" or an "M" you'll literally 
have to sue the government to get your stupid ass fucking letter on your stupid ass papers, and it'll 
cost you between €1000 and €2000, and it'll take much longer than changing it to a "F" or "M" would 
take.<a href="#source1" class="footnote">1)</a></p>
                <p>So yeah, when I got to talk to my "specialists" I lied my fucking ass off. Cuz like 
ofc I did? I just wanted E, and to change my name and sex marker. My gender is an unknowable, 
ununiform amalgamation of everything that isn't masculine. Like genuinely, the best definition I can 
give you of my gender is: "not a man" but like, I prefer to not have any definition at all for my 
gender. Anyway, I've got E patches rn. But it took me like 3 years in total, and that's fast for 
Dutch standards!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Gender is merely a social construct with the main goal of opressing a certain 
group of the population. When a bunch of white men found out that sex is a very fluid and not clearly 
defined concept, they just kinda made up gender in order to justify the orpession of 
women<a href="#source2" class="footnote">2)</a> and now that people have realized that gender too is 
not a rigit binary, conservatives don't know what to do anymore and are just back to claiming that sex 
is rigit and binary again. It's stupid, pathetic, and just sad. Like, they really just <i>need</i> 
to opress other people so badly that they'll jump through any amount of logics hoops they'll need.</p>
                <p>Get a fucking life man, and let me live mine without having to deal with you ass.</p>
