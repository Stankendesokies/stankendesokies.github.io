                    <p>The Body Mass Index (which I will just call "BMI" for the rest of this article)
is widely used in the medical world, anyone who has ever gone to a hospital would know. Medical 
professionals just <i>love</i> to measure your BMI. Oh, and in case you don't know what the hell "BMI" 
is: it's you weight (in kg) devided by your height (in m) to the power of 2. Which is to say that it's 
a <b>really</b> simple formula.</p>
                    <p>Which is just a little strange, cuz like, BMI is supposed to calulate rather or 
not you're healthy. If your BMI is less than 18.5 you're "underweight", 18.5 to 24.4 is "normal weight", 
24.5 to 29.9 is "overweight", and anything above 30 is "obese". So, this very simple, not at all 
complex formula, is used to calculate some pretty big stuff. For example: if you're at an 
endocrinologist because you've finally confinced your gender "specialist" that you're trans enough to 
recieve hormones, but your BMI is too low or too high, the endocrinologist could still deny you your 
hormones, because you first need to "get healthier". (This nearly happened to me, and I know people 
who have had this happen to)</p>
                    <p>"Ok, that sucks, but it makes sense right? If you're unhealthy some medicine can 
really fuck you up." Right, that makes sense. Except no it fucking doesn't. The human body is complex 
as fuck, and a simple formula that takes literally only 2 variables into account could never accurately 
calculate something as fague as "healthiness". Obviously more stuff effects your health, BMI has been 
demonstrated to claim that men are overweight when they aren't, and claim that people of colour are 
overweight when they aren't 
either.<a href="#source1" class="footnote">1)</a><a href="#source2" class="footnote">2)</a> And also, 
just think about it for like 30 seconds. Someone who runs marathons and shit all the time would 
definitely <b>have</b> to be healthy, but they'd also have a lot of muscle mass. The BMI formula 
doesn't know the difference between muscle mass and fat mass, so this extremely healthy person might 
still be considered "overweight" or even "obese" according to BMI.</p>
                    <p>And I didn't even get into the history of BMI yet. The guy (and yes, ofc it was 
a man) who invented BMI played a really massive role in early fucking 
eugenics.<a href="#source3" class="footnote">3)</a> He (his name was Adolphe Quetelet) did some 
measurements on some Scotish en French men in the mid 1800s, and based on those statistics decided that 
their average weight to height ratio was "ideal" / "normal" and something everyone should strive for. 
Later on, some dipshit called Francis Galton used Quetelet's work as one of the foundational pillars 
to create eugenics.<a href="#source4" class="footnote">4)</a> But it took until the 1900s for 
researchers to start using BMI, and it didn't even recieve the name "BMI" until 1972, and then it took 
another decade or so for medical professionals to start using it on individual patients to assess their 
health.<a href="#source5" class="footnote">5)</a></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So why do we still use BMI? Because the arguments to keep it around are weak at 
best and racist at worst. There is an alternative to BMI many people seem to praise: measuring the 
circumference of the patient's waist (in whatever unit you want), devided by your height (in the same 
unit as your waist). However, there aren't any official cutoffs, so medical professionals would have 
to decide themselves if their patients are healthy or not based on those measurements. Which is more 
effort than just sticking to BMI. And so most medical professionals don't want to make that 
switch.<a href="#source5" class="footnote">5)</a></p>
                    <p>But well, in my humble opinion, that's <b>bullshit</b>. All bodies are 
different and unique, and there'll never be a "1 formula fits all" situation. BMI, waist circumference, 
whatever else people'll come up with. There'll never be an easy and quick "shortcut" to determine 
rather or not someone is "healthy". The only way to do that, is by asking the person in question "hey, 
how do you feel?" and taking their personal opinion into genuine consideration. And of course, nobody 
can always perfectly determine their body's "healthiness" based on vibes. But listening to people's 
feelings and respecting their ability to make judgements would be much better than using an outdated, 
racist ass formula that literally lay the ground works for eugenics.</p>
