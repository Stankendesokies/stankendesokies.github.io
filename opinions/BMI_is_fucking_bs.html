                    <p>The Body Mass Index (which I will just call "BMI" for the rest of this article)
is widely used in the medical world, anyone who has ever gone to a hospital would know. Medical 
professionals just <i>love</i> to measure your BMI. Oh, and in case you don't know what the hell "BMI" 
is: it's you weight (in kg) devided by your height (in m) to the power of 2. Which is to say that it's 
a <b>really</b> simple formula.</p>
                    <p>Which is just a little strange, cuz like, BMI is supposed to calulate rather or 
not you're healthy.If your BMI is less than 18.5 you're "underweight", 18.5 to 24.4 is "normal weight", 
24.5 to 29.9 is "overweight", and anything above 30 is "obese". So, this very simple, not at all 
complex formula is used to calculate some pretty big stuff. For example: if you're at an 
endocrinologist because you've finally confinced your gender "specialist" that you're trans enough to 
recieve hormones. But your BMI is too low or too high the endocrinologist could still deny you your 
hormones, because you first need to "get healthier". (This nearly happened to me, and I know people 
who have had this happen to)</p>
                    <p>"Ok, that sucks, but it makes sense right? If you're unhealthy some medicine can 
really fuck you up." Right, that makes sense. Except no it fucking doesn't. The human body is complex 
as fuck, and a simple formula that takes literally only 2 variables into account could never accurately 
calculate something as fague as "healthiness". Just think about it for like 30 seconds. Someone who 
runs marathons and shit all the time would definitely be healthy, but they'd also have a lot of muscle 
mass. The BMI formula doesn't know the difference between muscle mass and fat mass, so this extremely 
healthy person might still be considered "overweight" or even "obese" according to BMI.</p>
                    <p>And I didn't even get into the history of BMI yet. The guy (and yes, ofc it was 
a man) who invented BMI played a really massive role in early fucking 
eugenics.<a href="#source1" class="footnote">1)</a> He (his name was Adolphe Quetelet) did some 
measurements on some Scotish en French men, and based on those statistics decided that their average 
weight to height ratio was "ideal" and "normal". Later on Francis Galton used Quetelet's work to create 
eugenics.<a href="#source2" class="footnote">2)</a></p>
